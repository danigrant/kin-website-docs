The Kin SDK for Python is meant to be used as a back-end service. It can perform
actions for your client apps (iOS, Android, etc.) and also operate as a server for you to
build services on top of the Kin Blockchain. The SDK can for example take care of
communicating with the Kin Blockchain on behalf of the client to create accounts
and whitelist transactions. It can also monitor blockchain transactions so that
you can implement broader services. It's up to you how to integrate the SDK in your
overall architecture and managing server up-time.


Getting started
----------------------------------------------

* **Requirements:** Make sure you have Python 3 >= 3.4

* **Installation:** ``pip install kin-sdk``

Overview
----------------------------------------------

Connect to Kin blockchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``KinClient`` class in the :py:mod:`~.client` module  lets you choose whether to connect to the Kin Blockchain testnet or mainnet.

You also use ``KinClient`` to create instances of ``KinAccount``.


Create and manage accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``KinAccount`` class in the :py:mod:`~.account` module lets you create accounts on the Kin Blockchain.
In the production environment your users are not authorized to create their own
accounts on the Kin Blockchain. The client code you develop will instead send a request to your server.
Your server will be authorized to create the account on their behalf.
It is up to you to properly authenticate your users before creating accounts.

If your app is authorized to execute transactions on the Kin Blockchain without
being charged a fee you will use the :py:func:`account.whitelist_transaction` function to sign user's transactions.
Your client code will send transactions to your server for authorization.
You will then return the signed transaction back to the client who will send the transaction to the
Horizon endpoint for execution on the Kin Blockchain.


Execute transactions on the Kin Blockchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the :py:mod:`~.transactions` module to execute transactions on the Kin Blockchain.
